## **Entry #1**  
**Date:** July 23, 2024  
### **Description: Documenting a Cybersecurity Incident**  

This incident occurred in two phases:  
1. **Detection and Analysis:**  
   - The organization first detected a **ransomware** incident.  
   - They contacted external organizations for **technical assistance**.  

2. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:**  
   - The organization **shut down** their computer systems to contain the incident.  
   - External assistance was required to **eradicate the threat** and **recover** from the attack.  

### **Tool(s) Used:**  
- None  

### **The 5 W's:**  
- **Who:** An **organized group of unethical hackers**.  
- **What:** A **ransomware** security incident.  
- **Where:** At a **healthcare company**.  
- **When:** Tuesday at **9:00 a.m.**.  
- **Why:** Attackers **gained access via a phishing attack** and launched **ransomware** to encrypt critical files.  
  - The attackers' **motivation appears financial**, as they left a ransom note demanding **payment** for a decryption key.  

### **Additional Notes:**  
1. How can the healthcare company **prevent** this from happening again?  
2. Should the company **pay the ransom** to retrieve the decryption key?

  - A **network protocol analyzer** that captures and analyzes network traffic.  
  - Helps **detect and investigate** malicious activity.  

### **The 5 W's:**  
- **Who:** N/A  
- **What:** N/A  
- **Where:** N/A  
- **When:** N/A  
- **Why:** N/A  

### **Additional Notes:**  
- First time using **Wireshark**—initially overwhelming but incredibly powerful for **understanding network traffic**.

## **Entry #3**  
**Date:** July 25, 2024  
### **Description: Capturing My First Packet**  

### **Tool(s) Used:**  
- **tcpdump**  
  - A **command-line** network protocol analyzer.  
  - Similar to Wireshark but used in **CLI-based network traffic analysis**.  

### **The 5 W's:**  
- **Who:** N/A  
- **What:** N/A  
- **Where:** N/A  
- **When:** N/A  
- **Why:** N/A  

### **Additional Notes:**  
- **New to command-line tools**, so capturing network traffic was challenging.  
- Made errors with commands but eventually **successfully captured network traffic**.

## **Entry #4**  
**Date:** July 27, 2024  
### **Description: Investigating a Suspicious File Hash**  

### **Tool(s) Used:**  
- **VirusTotal**  
  - An **investigative tool** for analyzing files and URLs for **malicious content**.  
  - Quickly identifies **indicators of compromise** reported by the cybersecurity community.  

### **Incident Phase:**  
- **Detection and Analysis:**  
  - Placed in the role of an **SOC analyst** investigating a **suspicious file hash**.  
  - Security systems detected a **malicious file**, triggering an alert.  
  - Deeper analysis confirmed it was a **real threat**.  

### **The 5 W's:**  
- **Who:** An **unknown malicious actor**.  
- **What:** An **email** with a **malicious file attachment**.  
  - **SHA-256 Hash:** `54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b`
